Hello,

A while ago there was an issue with our plugin being sold by you. It still has not been resolved. Your excuse was that the version you used was licensed under the GNU GPL, so you had every right to use the plugin as you did. Unfortunately for you, this has more recently been proved false:

On lines 34-38 the GNU GPL license states that if the software is distributed, the end user must be given a copy of the source code - which you aren’t doing - and they must also be informed that they have the same rights over the software as the distributor does. Basically the end user must be given the code and must be told they have the right to use the software for production, distribute it, sell it, and all the other rights included in the license.
And you are violating both of these.

	“For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
	gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
	freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
	or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
	know their rights.”

If you wish to reply to me and negotiate terms a conclusion satisfactory to both sides may be found, otherwise we have every right to do anything we can to force you to remove Functions from your app.
