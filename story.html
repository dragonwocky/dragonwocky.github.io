<i>Fire. Fire everywhere. Then darkness.
<br>
A boom echoes through my head.</i>
<br>
<br>
I open my eyes. It was not simply a dream, I am sure of that. I lie there, looking up at the canopy above me – birdsong is all I hear.
<br>
Again, I hear it. The peace of my surroundings shatters. Still in a dreamlike state, I find myself beginning to move. I can’t stop. Bushes rustle behind me. I run faster and faster. I have no control. My vision fades…
<br>
I stumble as I break through the tree line – the desert sand burns my bare feet. Suddenly my sight clears, all exhaustion fades. An egg, the size of a man, blood red with veins of black, sits but metres ahead of me. The air around it shimmers; the sand around it is clear and covered in magma-filled cracks.
<br>
The egg shudders and another boom sends a few brave lizards fleeing. The shell begins to break open, and the liquid rock flows towards it. A small, scaly creature emerges from the heat. Flapping its wings, it rises into the air – growing with each flap and incinerating all that remained in a single breath. Landing in a puff of sand, it roars, revealing all its gigantic majesty.
<br>
“Rise, boy. Tell me, who are you?” it rumbles at me.
<br>
I suddenly realise how… empty my head seems. I do not know my own past, let alone a name. In shock and wonderment, I stammer out my incoherent response.
<br>
“Very well then. From now on, you shall be known as Sage”, the dragon informs me, as if I have no choice on the matter, “Now, come here.”
<br>
<br>

<br>
Hireth, as I now know he is called, took me to a great cavern hidden among the northern mountains. My memory has still not returned, but he seems to have taken a special interest in me. He has spent many weeks educating me in… language, mathematics, the arts – more knowledge seems to be contained in the head of this hatchling who has never had contact with the rest of the world than seems possible. Today we leave, bound for the capital city of G’ælethir.
<br>
“Are you ready?” Hireth strides purposefully towards me.
<br>
Confidently, I reply. “Yes.”
<br>
Shapeshifting into his true form (an act of magic that never ceases to puzzle me), he takes off, circling and dipping just far enough below the peak for me to leap onto his back.
<br>
Now that I know who and what my companion is, I relax, taking in the sights and experiencing the pure joy of flight. After what seems like a matter of mere minutes, we arrive. Hireth lands in the centre of a large park. We are surrounded by a respectful, expectant silence. As I look around, I once again fall into doubt. Nobody else looks in the slightest like me – there are gigantic, horned minotaurs, short, bearded dwarves with strange hammers stuck through the belts, and lithe elves with chiselled features. I am an oddity with my violet eyes, medium stature and brown hair.
<br>
“It is time. The land is filled with chaos. I have come… with a new ruler.”
<br>
The words rumble through the air, and I wonder who he’s talking about.
<br>
“Yes, you, Sage. You are now the 14th chosen king of G’ælethir.”
<br>
The last thing I remember is seeing hesitant smiles on the faces of the dwarves closest to me as they turned to each other, and a murderous look on the face of a certain group of elves.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px"><b>Three years later.</b></span>
<br>
I laugh as an old memory surfaces. Fainting in front of many of my new subjects did not leave a very good first impression. It took me a long time to stabilise the economy, with the only excitement being occasional assassination attempts by the jealous former rulers, and the only rest being on those days when I could get lost exploring the palace – I was probably the first visitor some of those rooms had had for decades.
<br>
Last week, I found something new. It was a strange, circular hole in the wall. The edges were a shiny metal that no matter what I did, I could leave no marks on, and although the hole did not go far, it was filled with a crackling blue energy. Hireth says it is called a “portal” on his last visit. While I am gone, I am leaving the dwarf Thorin in charge. I step forward, close my eyes, and disappear.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px"><b>Location - Earth. Time - 7:35 PM, 04/03/3014</b></span>
<br>
I emerge in a dusty, underground storeroom. Moving boxes out of the way, I march up the stairs and out the door, determined to determine my whereabouts. Outside is a world of strange metal contraptions and narrow lanes. A girl runs past me, looking to be only slightly older than me, followed by a gang of others wielding strangely shaped tubes that seem to be shooting chunks of glass towards the girl. This is my chance to make an ally.
<br>
“Stop!” I thunder in my most commanding voice, temporarily giving pause to those chasing the boy as they process what I just said and who I look to be. Drawing my sword I easily outpace them, running between them and knocking the weapons out of their hands. Throwing four of the five tubes to the girl who had now stopped running, watching the proceedings with confusion, I lifted the fifth, pointing it towards the group, mimicking how they had held the tubes earlier to pretend I knew how to use them. That was the final straw for them, and without a word, they turned back the way they’d come and ran.
<br>
I turned towards the girl, doing a double take. My mouth dropped open. “You’re…. you’re like me!” I gasped.
<br>
“What, human? Yeah, most of us are… Who are you anyway?” she replied dryly.
<br>
“I’m sorry… I’ve just never seen another human before. Call me Sage. I’m new to this land.”
<br>
“What’s that supposed to mean? No, don’t answer that. I assume you’re another of the refugees. I’m Alex. Come with me, I’ll take you to somewhere you can spend the night.”
<br>
That evening I sat in a room with about seven others, who Alex said were refugees. I tried to convince her I had experienced memory loss. Amnesia, she called it. I don’t know if she believed me, but she explained anyway. The technology had been progressing at an incredible speed, with all sorts of new discoveries daily. Then suddenly, there was a meeting of the Earth Council. All technology that had anything to do with time travel, teleportation, or interdimensional travel was restricted. The economies of many mainland countries failed, and refugees began heading towards island countries like Australia and New Zealand to attempt to escape the poverty. The government didn’t like it, neither did the local street gangs. People like her were the only ones who would welcome the refugees and give them shelter.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px"><b>Meanwhile, back in G’ælethir.</b></span>
<br>
Hireth frowns down at the bloody streets below. The elves, led by L’ndirai, the former ruler, had slaughtered the royal guards, overthrowing Thorin and forcing him to hide in the maze of rooms and hallways that was the old palace. He considers his options. For the first time in millennia, a human had travelled between the worlds. What he had done was public knowledge. The elves would go after him. Was it time? Yes.
<br>
Silently, he turned and flew faster than could ever have been possible – over the mountains, the forests, the ocean. Back to the birthplace of all dragons, the red desert.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px"><b>Location - Earth. Time - 9:12 AM, 05/03/3014</b></span>
<br>
I had to make a decision. I could return home, or investigate this new world. Curiosity got the better of me… G’ælethir could wait; it was in good hands with Thorin and Hireth. After all – if my suspicions are correct, this technologic shutdown of Earth had to do with G’ælethir.
<br>
“Alex, I need to know more. Where can I find the government labs that deal with this technology?”
<br>
She looks at me quizzically, “Why on Earth would you want to go there?”
<br>
“Would you believe me if I said I came from another world?” I reply.
<br>
“Not really.”
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px"><b>Five minutes later.</b></span>
<br>
“I still can’t believe you convinced me to do this,” she mutters as we cut the fence.
<br>
I grin and ducking through the gap, walk straight towards the main complex, making sure to look like I had every right to be there. Somehow, it works. Nobody stops us.
<br>
It takes all my willpower not to stop and stare at the fantastical machines around me. Moving pictures that respond to thought commands, ground that moves on its own. I go through every door and hallway I see marked restricted. Finally, I find one that does not open.
<br>
“A fingerprint scanner!” Alex looks smug, pulling a small knife out and messing with some of the wires, “I haven’t messed with one of these in years.”
<br>
Within seconds, the display turns green and the reinforced door slid open. A single screen, with a red portal on the wall. We walk to the screen and bring up the only file visible. As I read, the foundations of my very mind are destroyed. I have to get back to G’ælethir. Before I had the chance to think, I leapt through the red portal, leaving my birthplace behind.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px"><b>Location - Red Desert, Home of the Dragons.</b></span>
<br>
The wind blows my hair out of my face, revealing the purple eyes that seem to make me so unique wherever I go. The air shimmers with heat, and the portal behind me is barely visible through the sandstorm. Alex steps up behind me, waking me from the thoughts that swirl through my head. She read it as well.
<br>
“You were right… everything I knew, everything I believed… a myth,” she murmurs, with tears in her eyes. “What do we do?”
<br>
I had no answer. I couldn’t be certain of anything anymore. I simply shook my head.
<br>
What seemed to be an eternity later, we got our answer. He came. Of course he came. I don’t know whether to be glad of his arrival or hate his very existence. Surprisingly, Alex didn’t go into shock. I certainly would have. I guess her mind was already dealing with enough that being faced with a new impossibility didn’t change much.
<br>
“Why? Why didn’t you tell me?” I say, my voice shaking. “You never thought I would like to know who I really was?”
<br>
“Sage… You know I could never have. You of all people should understand. Prophecies do not work that way.” Hireth replies gently. “Climb up onto my back. It is time you met your father.”
<br>
“What about me? I’m not being left to just go back home, not now that I know.” Alex butts in defiantly.
<br>
The regal beast’s chest rumbles with what could almost be mistaken for a laugh. “It seems your new friend has spirit, Sage. How do you feel about riding a dragon, girl?”
<br>
<br>
<i>The same dream. Fire, fire everywhere. This time, however, I see a figure in the flames. It comes closer… and soon I am looking into my own tormented eyes. I hear a whisper, but cannot catch the words…</i>
<br>
I wake to the wind rushing past me. I feel physically refreshed, but my mind is filled with doom. Behind me, Alex still sleeps. Looking back at her, a brief flash of an emotion I have never before experienced rips through me, filling me with a surge of terrified happiness that I do not understand. The moment is lost as we dive through the layer of cloud, landing with a jolt that wakes Alex from her slumber.
<br>
I take in my surroundings. A valley, surrounded by a circle of mountains. The valley is peaceful, full of all kinds of plants and small animals. I look up. At the peak of each mountain, a dragon rests, each dragon a different colour. Only two of the fifteen mountains do not have their own dragon.
<br>
“I must leave you now.” Hireth takes off once again, circling to gain height and then heading towards the smaller of the two mountains. That solves the mystery of one of them. My guess was that each dragon had chosen one of the 14 kings. At least this time I had not lost my memory, I still had an operating mind.
<br>
We sit for a while. Suddenly, Alex rises and begins to move towards the trees.
<br>
“Come on, Sage. Let’s see what there is to see.” She calls back to me as she begins to run. I follow, soon finding myself having difficulty keeping up as I dodge all the trees she seems to slide past with ease. Then suddenly, she disappears. I can’t see her anywhere. All directions look the same, I can’t tell where I came from. I’m lost. I begin to despair, cursing my curiosity for getting me into this mess. If only I had been content to rule, instead of stupidly going off to explore strange new worlds. No, nothing would have changed. Some way or another, I would still have ended up here. Everything that I have learned in the past day ravages through my mind once again.
<br>
She finds me like this, curled up in the dirt, no longer caring, consumed by my own worry.
<br>
“Don’t give up. Not now.” I appreciate that she tries to reason with me gently, without the scornful tone I expected she would use with the weak excuse for a king I am. “Sage. Get up. I found someone who wants to talk to you.”
<br>
I allow myself to obey her; grateful for something to do that doesn’t require too much thinking. I follow her as she navigates the maze of trees without hesitation. We emerge in a small clearing. The sky above us is star-speckled. I feel distantly surprised that so much time has passed. Finally, my eyes focus on… whatever, or whoever, the thing standing in the middle is. It has the body of a horse, but where its neck would have begun, a human torso rises, ending in a pair of muscled arms leaning on a sword hilt, the point dug into the ground, and a bearded head that seems ageless.
<br>
“My son.” It beckons.
<br>
“Who… who are you?” I gather my thoughts enough to regain control of myself, at least temporarily.
<br>
“Chiron. The last centaur. Some call me the ancient one. I am the only living being who can remember the time before the separation.” He answers sadly, “Sage, I am your father. From the moment you were born, I knew you were special. Your mother was queen of the dragons, but she passed away soon after you were born. It broke my heart to let you go as well.”
<br>
“You sent me thousands of years into the future, wiped my memory, and placed me in a world where I was the only one who was even partially human.” I reply with barely controlled rage, “Now the two worlds you tried so hard to save by hiding them from each other, are about to go to war once again. This time, they will destroy each other.”
<br>
“Sage… can you really not remember how I separated the worlds? You are the rightful ruler of both realms, the lost prince of what was once called Blackthornia. You tied the essences of myth and science together. Let me tell you a story my father once told me…
<br>
At the beginning of time, everything was perfect. One day, however, a curious child found a small box hidden in the hollow trunk of a tree. When they opened it, out came all the evils that now infects our worlds. The child was horrified, but then one last thing fluttered slowly up and out of the box. Hope. Have hope, my son.”
<br>
“What do I have to do?”
<br>
He beckons, “Come. I leave you one last gift before I too leave this world forever. The heart of the mountain with the highest peak has a single vial contained within it. Drink it.”
<br>
With that, he rides off into the distance. I have a feeling we will never see him again.
<br>
“I guess we better get moving.” Alex takes my arm and begins to lead me towards the only mountain without a dragon standing guard on it. It doesn’t take long for us to arrive at the dark entrance to a tunnel.
<br>
Regaining some of my confidence as an illogical sense of familiarity washes over me, I attempt to do the hero thing and say I should do this alone. Alex dismisses my concerns with laughter. We step forwards, following the tunnel. Luckily, there are not many turns and the ground is fairly clear, so even though it’s pitch black, we manage not to fall over or crash into walls too many times. After an age of walking, we arrive at what must have been the centre. A crystal pedestal glows an eerie light blue, and on top sits an unadorned silver vial, just like Chiron described.
<br>
The moment I lift it off its stand, we begin to rise at speed. In seconds, we have reached the cave’s roof. I brace for impact, but when I open my eyes, we have passed through it. The platform has ground to a halt above the clouds, right at the mountain’s peak.
<br>
I open the vial. The liquid inside is mostly clear, with strange swirls of red and green all through it. Before my nerve gets the better of me, I drink it in one gulp. Once again, everything changes…
<br>
I step forward, and leap into space. I hear a shriek behind me as Alex reaches for my arm to stop my descent, but misses. I open my eyes, with a fire burning behind them. I scream all my emotion at the sky, expelling the frustration and pain of recent days – but also a strange excitement I did not realise I had. I spread wings I did not know I had and rise up high above the land. As I fly, my memory begins to heal. I find myself over the palace, see the army gathering, preparing to go through the portal. I remember a childhood, running rampant wherever I pleased. I remembered the first war. Humans had begun to develop incredible technology, and the magical beasts of the land turned against them, led by the elves. History was repeating itself. I fly even further.
<br>
I do not know where I am heading. I hear nothing. Light and colours around me blur. Without any conscious acknowledgement of my arrival, I drop directly down and descend into an active volcano. As I sink beneath the lava, I feel it burning away the damage done to my mind and body. I rise once again, reborn like a phoenix. My mind is clear for the first time in what seems like forever.
<br>
First... Alex. She probably thinks I went insane and committed suicide, leaping off a mountain like that. I turn back the way I came, experiencing once again the pure joy of flight. As I fly back towards the ring of mountains, slightly more relaxed this time, I watch the ground beneath me change. It is no longer G’ælethir… but it doesn’t look like Earth either. It’s somewhere between the two.
<br>
When I arrive, I see her sitting in the centre of the valley, where we first landed. I greet the other dragons standing guard in their own tongue, and then land softly a short distance behind her.
<br>
“Alex?” I call to her. She turns towards me.
<br>
“How? How are you alive?” She says in disbelief, “I thought I was stuck here forever… I would never have seen my family again.”
<br>
I grin; glad to see that her spirit was not broken like mine had been. “Apparently, I can fly.”
<br>
This time, I am the one encouraging her to keep moving as we climb to the top of what I now think of as “my mountain”.
<br>
“Everything has changed.” She exclaims, looking down at the land, “What was it Chiron called it? Blackthornia. Earth and G’ælethir are one place again.”
<br>
“Yes… but the humans and elves are still preparing for a war. We have to stop them before they wipe each other out.” I reply.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 16px"><b>Two hours later.</b><span>
<br>
“This is a terrible plan,” I grumble at the girl sitting on my back. I’ve figured out how to shapeshift into a real dragon, large enough to carry at least one passenger. “What makes you think that by recklessly flying right into the middle of everything they’ll stop?
<br>
I get the same reply I got last time: “Well, for once the humans aren’t the ones to blame, and you are the king of the G’ælethirians. If you can get most of them to stop, then the few remaining who really want to fight a war will be hopelessly outnumbered. From what I know of humans, too, since they aren’t the instigators of this, the large bulk of the soldiers will just go home if you negotiate a truce, and everyone else… well, they’re not exactly likely to try and fight a dragon.”
<br>
<br>
<i>However, Alex’s plan worked. I am an old man now, and my son will soon take my place. In the months that followed, everything changed, for everyone. Sometimes it’s difficult, having magic and science mixing daily, but surprisingly most people have benefited from it. One day, I hope someone will find this. Maybe they will find pleasure in reading about my adventures, possibly even learn something from them.
